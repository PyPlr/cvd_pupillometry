Pupillometry
============

Pupillometry is the measurement of the size and reactivity of the eyes' pupils. It is usually performed by researchers and clinicians with specialist equipment, like an eye tracking device or a dedicated pupilometer, although clinicians can sometimes get the insights they need through manual observation. The pupils are interesting because their dynamics reflect the integrity and activity of the central nervous system. As such, they are a window of insight into neurological health but also into aspects of higher cognitive function such as arousal, attention, and mental effort.
