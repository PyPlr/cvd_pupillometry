    "The human retina has five classes of photoreceptor: rods, cones (S, M, L) and intrinsically photosenstive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGC). The rods are responsible for vision in the dark (scotopic vision) and the cones are responsible for daytime vision. The ipRGCs aThe photoreceptors are tuned to different wavelengths of light, as described by th sensetivity curve essentially describes the probability that a photoreceptor will absorb a photon of light at a given wavelength. \n",
